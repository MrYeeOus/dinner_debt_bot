# The Dinner Debt Bot
yes, the name is really horrible for something rather trivial
---
A bot that tracks how much each member in the party owes the other members, for dinner.

## Usage (so far):
* Prepare environment:`pip install -f requirements.txt`
* ~Put your pal's names in `names.list`~
* Run `python dinner_debtor_bot.py`

---
## TODO:
* Implement data handling (i.e. processing data inputted by user, and applying it to a database)
* Implement user "profile" (i.e. check how much user owes/has earnt)
